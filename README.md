Capstone LVC Toolkit
1.	Title and Description: Like most great documents, you want to describe what, precisely, your code is and what it is (supposed) to do. The more detail you give here, the easier it will be for others to understand what the intent of your capstone project is. For the sake of your project, this will be broken down into the following:
  a.	Problem: What, precisely, is the problem you are trying to solve in this project?
  b.	Motivation: What motivated the solution of the problem, and why is this problem important?
  c.	Related Work: Similar papers and repositories that do similar things to what you are solving, that you consulted when trying to solve your problem of    interest.
  d.	Anticipated Tasks: What tasks are you planning to do, and which have been solved? ( Use a checkbox system to indicate progress ).
  e.	Capacity Gaps: What are the capacity gaps that can be critical? 
  f.	Capability Gaps: What are the capacity gaps that can be critical?
  g.	AI2C Fit: How does this project fit to AI2C goals.  
  h.	RFI’s for customer: How do you request information about the customer your capstone targets?
